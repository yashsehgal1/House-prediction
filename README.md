# House price prediction

This data science project walks through predicting house price in bengaluru, India. We will first build a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com. During model building we will cover almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc. 
Technology and tools wise this project covers-

Python
Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
Matplotlib for data visualization
Sklearn for model building
Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
